<p>My name is Natasha. I have been doing Taekwondo for the past decade. Throughout these years I've rosen through the ranks and become a 2nd degree black belt. I used to compete for Taekwondo. I placed 1st in the state-wide tournament and 6th nationally. I no longer compete but I still love to practice my forms and spar with my peers. I plan on testing for my 3rd degree black belt this fall</p>
